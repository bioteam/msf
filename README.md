# MSF Parser #

A Thermo MSF file parser using ActiveRecord as ORM.
MSF files are SQLite3-based.
This library provides a simple API using ActiveRecord that is directly translatable to the databaseâ€™s schema.

This gem takes heavily from Angel Pizzaro's thermo_msf gem.

## WARNING ##

This gem has not been developed to completion.
It has only been taken sufficiently far to serve my present needs.

It has not been tested on MSF files other than those generated by my instrument
operating my version of Thermo's Proteome Discoverer (1.3).

## Installation ##

    gem install msf

## Usage ##

    msf = MSF.new({:path => msf_file})
    Peptides.all do |peptide|
      <whatever>
    end

    ibspectra msf_file >> msf_file/msf_file.ibspectra.csv

## Note ##

See erd/erd.png for an Entity Relationship Diagram of the MSF schema.
